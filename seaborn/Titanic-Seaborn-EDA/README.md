# 🚢 Titanic Data Analysis using Seaborn

## 📊 Project Overview

This project is a beginner-level Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset using **Python, Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib**.
The goal is to analyze passenger survival patterns using visualizations.

## 🧰 Technologies Used

* Python
* Pandas
* Seaborn
* Matplotlib

## 📁 Dataset

The dataset is loaded using Seaborn’s built-in dataset:

```python
df = sns.load_dataset("titanic")
```

## 📌 Analysis Performed

This project includes the following visualizations:

* Survival Count Plot
* Survival Based on Gender
* Survival Based on Passenger Class
* Age Distribution of Passengers
* Age vs Passenger Class (Boxplot)
* Correlation Heatmap

## 🖼️ Output

All graphs are saved as high-quality images (300 DPI) inside the `images` folder.

## 🎯 Key Learning Outcomes

* Statistical visualization using Seaborn
* Creating multiple subplots
* Saving figures as image files

## ▶️ How to Run the Project

1. Install required libraries:

```bash
pip install pandas seaborn matplotlib
```

2. Run the Python file:

```bash
python titanic_analysis.py
```
