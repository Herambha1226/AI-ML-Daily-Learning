# 📊 Student Performance Analysis & Visualization System

A complete data visualization project built using **Matplotlib, Pandas, Seaborn, and NumPy** to analyze student academic performance.

This project demonstrates real-world Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using professional 2D and 3D visualizations.

---

## 🚀 Objectives

- Analyze student performance data
- Study relationships between features (Study Hours, Attendance, Final Score)
- Practice real ML-style EDA workflow
- Build a portfolio-ready visualization project

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python
- Matplotlib
- Pandas
- Seaborn


---

## 📊 Visualizations Implemented

- 📈 Line Plot (Performance Trend)
- 📊 Bar Chart (Subject-wise Comparison)
- 📉 Histogram (Score Distribution)
- 🔵 2D Scatter Plot (Hours vs Score)
- 🌌 3D Scatter Plot (Hours, Attendance, Score)
- 🔥 Heatmap (Correlation Analysis)
- 📊 Subplots Dashboard

All figures are saved using:

```python
plt.savefig("output/filename.png", dpi=300, bbox_inches="tight")
```
